description: Stage, commit, and push the current branch following git governance rules.
---

1. Run `/review` to ensure lint/tests/security checks pass locally.
2. Review and stage changes with `git add` (avoid staging generated or secret files).
3. Craft a Conventional Commit message (types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore, revert).
   - Use `.github/commit-template.txt` and include Context / Testing / Reviewers blocks.
   - Never add AI attribution strings to commits.
4. Commit with `git commit` using the prepared message. If commitlint fails, fix the message and retry.
5. Push to origin: `git push origin $(git branch --show-current)`.
6. Trigger remote checks for visibility:
   - `gh workflow run ci-commit-branch-guard.yml --ref $(git branch --show-current)`
   - `gh workflow run ci-quality-gate.yml --ref $(git branch --show-current)`
7. Wait for both workflows to finish (`gh run watch --workflow ci-quality-gate.yml`) before opening a pull request.
