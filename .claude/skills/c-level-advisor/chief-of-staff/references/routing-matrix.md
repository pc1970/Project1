# Routing Matrix

Detailed routing rules for the Chief of Staff. When a founder asks a question, find the best match in this matrix, then apply the scoring rules to determine single-role, multi-role, or board meeting.

## When to Invoke Multiple Roles

Invoke 2 roles when:
- The question sits at the boundary of two domains
- One role's answer creates a constraint the other needs to know about
- The founder explicitly wants two perspectives

Invoke 3+ roles (board) when:
- The question involves irreversible resource commitment
- There's a known tension between functions (e.g., product vs revenue, speed vs quality)
- The answer will change how multiple teams operate
- It's a company-direction question, not an operational one

---

## When NOT to Invoke Multiple Roles

Don't multi-invoke when:
- The answer is technical and one role clearly owns it
- The founder just needs a framework, not a decision
- Invoking more roles would add noise without adding signal
- Time is short and a directional answer beats a comprehensive one

---

## Escalation Criteria → Board Meeting

Automatically escalate to board meeting when any of these apply:

1. **Irreversibility:** The decision is hard or impossible to reverse (layoffs, pivots, major contracts, fundraising terms)
2. **Cross-functional resource impact:** The decision changes budget, headcount, or priorities for 2+ teams
3. **Founder blind spot risk:** The topic is in an area where the founder's archetype creates a known gap (e.g., technical founder on GTM)
4. **Disagreement expected:** The domains involved are known to have competing incentives (CFO vs CRO on pricing, CTO vs CPO on tech debt)
5. **Explicit request:** Founder says "what does the team think" or "I want multiple perspectives"
6. **Score ≥ 4**

## Complementary Skills Registry

These skills are invoked for specific cross-cutting needs, not for general domain questions.

### Orchestration & Infrastructure

| Context Engine | Auto-loaded; staleness check | context-engine |
| Board Meeting | `/cs:board`, multi-role decisions, score ≥ 4 | board-meeting |
| Decision Logger | After board meetings, `/cs:decisions`, `/cs:review` | decision-logger |
| Agent Protocol | Inter-role invocations, loop detection | agent-protocol |

### Cross-Cutting Capabilities
| Skill | Trigger | File |
|-------|---------|------|
| Board Deck Builder | "board deck", "investor update", "board presentation" | board-deck-builder |

### Routing Priority

1. Check if it matches a **complementary skill trigger** → route there
2. Check if it matches a **single role domain** → route to that role
3. Check if it spans **multiple role domains** (score ≥ 3) → invoke multiple roles
4. Check if it meets **escalation criteria** (score ≥ 4 or irreversible) → trigger board meeting
5. If unclear → ask one clarifying question, then route
