# Competitive Intelligence

Systematic competitor tracking. Not obsession — intelligence that drives real decisions.

## Keywords
competitive intelligence, competitor analysis, battlecard, win/loss analysis, competitive positioning, competitive tracking, market intelligence, competitor research, SWOT, competitive map, feature gap analysis, competitive strategy

## Quick Start

```
/ci:landscape         — Map your competitive space (direct, indirect, future)
/ci:battlecard [name] — Build a sales battlecard for a specific competitor
/ci:winloss           — Analyze recent wins and losses by reason
/ci:update [name]     — Track what a competitor did recently
/ci:map               — Build competitive positioning map
```

## Framework: 5-Layer Intelligence System

### Layer 1: Competitor Identification

**Direct competitors:** Same ICP, same problem, comparable solution, similar price point.
**Indirect competitors:** Same budget, different solution (including "do nothing" and "build in-house").
**Future competitors:** Well-funded startups in adjacent space; large incumbents with stated roadmap overlap.

**The 2x2 Threat Matrix:**

| | Same ICP | Different ICP |
|---|---|---|
| **Same problem** | Direct threat | Adjacent (watch) |
| **Different problem** | Displacement risk | Ignore for now |

Update this quarterly. Who's moved quadrants?

### Layer 2: Tracking Dimensions

Track these 8 dimensions per competitor:

| Dimension | Sources | Cadence |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Product moves** | Changelog, G2/Capterra reviews, Twitter/LinkedIn | Monthly |
| **Pricing changes** | Pricing page, sales call intel, customer feedback | Triggered |
| **Funding** | Crunchbase, TechCrunch, LinkedIn | Triggered |
| **Hiring signals** | LinkedIn job postings, Indeed | Monthly |
| **Partnerships** | Press releases, co-marketing | Triggered |
| **Customer wins** | Case studies, review sites, LinkedIn | Monthly |
| **Customer losses** | Win/loss interviews, churned accounts | Ongoing |
| **Messaging shifts** | Homepage, ads (Facebook/Google Ad Library) | Quarterly |

### Layer 3: Analysis Frameworks

**SWOT per Competitor:**
- Strengths: What do they do well? Where do they win?
- Weaknesses: Where do they lose? What do customers complain about?
- Opportunities: What could they do that would threaten you?
- Threats: What's their existential risk?

**Competitive Positioning Map (2 axis):**
Choose axes that matter for your buyers:
- Common: Price vs Feature Depth; Enterprise-ready vs SMB-ready; Easy to implement vs Configurable
- Pick axes that show YOUR differentiation clearly

**Feature Gap Analysis:**
| Feature | You | Competitor A | Competitor B | Gap status |
|---------|-----|-------------|-------------|------------|
| [Feature] | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | Your advantage |
| [Feature] | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | Gap — roadmap? |
| [Feature] | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | Moat |
| [Feature] | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | Competitor B only |

### Layer 4: Output Formats

**For Sales (CRO):** Battlecards — one page per competitor, designed for pre-call prep.
See `templates/battlecard-template.md`

**For Marketing (CMO):** Positioning update — message shifts, new differentiators, claims to stop or start making.

**For Product (CPO):** Feature gap summary — what customers ask for that we don't have, what competitors ship, what to reprioritize.

**For CEO/Board:** Monthly competitive summary — 1-page: who moved, what it means, recommended responses.

### Layer 5: Intelligence Cadence

**Monthly (scheduled):**
- Review all tier-1 competitors (direct threats, top 3)
- Update battlecards with new intel
- Publish 1-page summary to leadership

**Triggered (event-based):**
- Competitor raises funding → assess implications within 48 hours
- Competitor launches major feature → product + sales response within 1 week
- Competitor poaches key customer → win/loss interview within 2 weeks
- Competitor changes pricing → analyze and respond within 1 week

**Quarterly:**
- Full competitive landscape review
- Update positioning map
- Refresh ICP competitive threat assessment
- Add/remove companies from tracking list

## Win/Loss Analysis

This is the highest-signal competitive data you have. Most companies do it too rarely.

**When to interview:**
- Every lost deal >$50K ACV
- Every churn >6 months tenure
- Every competitive win (learn why — it may not be what you think)

**Who conducts it:**
- NOT the AE who worked the deal (too close, prospect won't be candid)
- Customer success, product team, or external researcher

**Question structure:**
1. "Walk me through your evaluation process"
2. "Who else were you considering?"
3. "What were the top 3 criteria in your decision?"
4. "Where did [our product] fall short?"
5. "What was the deciding factor?"
6. "What would have changed your decision?"

**Aggregate findings monthly:**
- Win reasons (rank by frequency)
- Loss reasons (rank by frequency)
- Competitor win rates (by competitor, by segment)
- Patterns over time

## The Balance: Intelligence Without Obsession

**Signs you're over-tracking competitors:**
- Roadmap decisions are primarily driven by "they just shipped X"
- Team morale drops when competitors fundraise
- You're shipping features you don't believe in to match their checklist
- Pricing discussions always start with "well, they charge X"

**Signs you're under-tracking:**
- Your AEs get blindsided on calls
- Prospects know more about competitors than your team does
- You missed a major product launch until customers told you
- Your positioning hasn't changed in 12+ months despite market moves

**The right posture:**
- Know competitors well enough to win against them
- Don't let them set your agenda
- Your roadmap is led by customer problems, informed by competitive gaps

## Distributing Intelligence

| Audience | Format | Cadence | Owner |
|----------|--------|---------|-------|
| AEs + SDRs | Updated battlecards in CRM | Monthly + triggered | CRO |
| Product | Feature gap analysis | Quarterly | CPO |
| Marketing | Positioning brief | Quarterly | CMO |
| Leadership | 1-page competitive summary | Monthly | CEO/COO |
| Board | Competitive landscape slide | Quarterly | CEO |

**One source of truth:** All competitive intel lives in one place (Notion, Confluence, Salesforce). Avoid Slack-only distribution — it disappears.

## Red Flags in Competitive Intelligence

| Signal | What it means |
|--------|---------------|
| Competitor's win rate >50% in your core segment | Fundamental positioning problem, not sales problem |
| Same objection from 5+ deals: "competitor has X" | Feature gap that's real, not just optics |
| Competitor hired 10 engineers in your domain | Major product investment incoming |
| Competitor raised >$20M and targets your ICP | 12-month runway for them to compete hard |
| Prospects evaluate you to justify competitor decision | You're the "check box" — fix perception or segment |

## Integration with C-Suite Roles

| Intelligence Type | Feeds To | Output Format |
|------------------|----------|---------------|
| Product moves | CPO | Roadmap input, feature gap analysis |
| Pricing changes | CRO, CFO | Pricing response recommendations |
| Funding rounds | CEO, CFO | Strategic positioning update |
| Hiring signals | CHRO, CTO | Talent market intelligence |
| Customer wins/losses | CRO, CMO | Battlecard updates, positioning shifts |
| Marketing campaigns | CMO | Counter-positioning, channel intelligence |
