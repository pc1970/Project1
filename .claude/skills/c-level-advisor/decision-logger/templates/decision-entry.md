## Field Rules

| Field | Rule |
|-------|------|
| Decision | Must be a single statement. If it takes two sentences, split into two decisions. |
| Owner | One person or role. "Everyone" owns nothing. |
| Deadline | Required. No "TBD". If unknown, set 14 days and review. |
| Review | Always set. Minimum 1 day after deadline. |
| Rationale | Required. "Because we decided so" is not rationale. |
| User Override | Honest record. Do not soften or omit. |
| Rejected | Every rejected proposal must be listed. |
| DO_NOT_RESURFACE | Applied to every rejected item. No exceptions. |

## Marking Action Items Complete

When an action item is done, update the entry in decisions.md:

```markdown
- [x] [Action text] — Owner: [name] — Completed: [YYYY-MM-DD] — Result: [one sentence outcome]
```

Do not delete completed items. The history is the record.
