- **Manager-to-IC ratio** — Green: 1:5–1:8, Yellow: 1:3–1:5 or 1:8–1:12, Red: outside
- **Internal promotion rate** — at least 25-30% of senior roles filled internally

### 6. 🔄 Operational Health (COO)
**What it measures:** Are we executing our strategy with discipline?

Key metrics:
- **OKR completion rate** — % of key results hitting target (Green: >70%, Yellow: 50-70%, Red: <50%)
- **Decision cycle time** — days from decision needed to decision made (Green: <48h, Yellow: 48h-1w)
- **Meeting effectiveness** — % of meetings with clear outcome (qualitative)
- **Process maturity** — level 1-5 scale (see COO advisor)
- **Cross-functional initiative completion** — % on time, on scope

### 7. 🔒 Security Health (CISO)
**What it measures:** Are we protecting customers and maintaining compliance?

### 8. 📣 Market Health (CMO)
**What it measures:** Are we winning in the market and growing efficiently?

Key metrics:
- **CAC trend** — improving, flat, or worsening QoQ
- **Organic vs paid lead mix** — more organic = healthier (less fragile)

## Scoring & Traffic Lights

Each dimension is scored 1-10 with traffic light:
- 🟢 **Green (7-10):** Healthy — maintain and optimize
- 🟡 **Yellow (4-6):** Watch — trend matters; improving or declining?
- 🔴 **Red (1-3):** Action required — address within 30 days

**Overall Health Score:**
Weighted average by company stage (see `references/health-benchmarks.md` for weights).

## Dimension Interactions (Why One Problem Creates Another)

| If this dimension is red... | Watch these dimensions next |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Financial Health | People (freeze hiring) → Engineering (freeze infra) → Product (cut scope) |
| Revenue Health | Financial (cash gap) → People (attrition risk) → Market (lose positioning) |
| People Health | Engineering (velocity drops) → Product (quality drops) → Revenue (churn rises) |
| Engineering Health | Product (features slip) → Revenue (deals stall on product) |
| Product Health | Revenue (NRR drops, churn rises) → Market (CAC rises; referrals dry up) |
| Operational Health | All dimensions degrade over time (execution failure cascades everywhere) |

DIMENSION SCORES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
💰 Financial    🟢 8.2  Runway 14mo, burn 1.6x — strong
📈 Revenue      🟡 5.8  NRR 104%, pipeline thin (1.8x coverage)
🚀 Product      🟢 7.4  NPS 42, DAU/MAU 38%
⚙️  Engineering  🟡 5.2  Debt at 30%, MTTR 3.2h
👥 People       🔴 3.8  Attrition 24%, eng morale low
🔄 Operations   🟡 6.0  OKR 65% completion
🔒 Security     🟢 7.8  SOC 2 Type II complete, 0 incidents
📣 Market       🟡 5.5  CAC rising, win rate dropped to 22%
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

TOP PRIORITIES
🔴 [1] People: attrition at 24% — engineering velocity will drop in 60 days
   Action: CHRO + CEO to run retention audit; target top 5 at-risk this week
🟡 [2] Revenue: pipeline coverage at 1.8x — Q+1 miss risk is high
   Action: CRO to add 3 qualified opps within 30 days or shift forecast down
🟡 [3] Engineering: tech debt at 30% of sprint — shipping will slow by Q3
   Action: CTO to propose debt sprint plan; COO to protect capacity

WATCH
→ People → Engineering cascade risk if attrition continues (see dimension interactions)

## Graceful Degradation

You don't need all metrics to run a diagnostic. The tool handles partial data:
- Missing metric → excluded from score, flagged as "[data needed]"
- Score still valid for available dimensions
- Report flags which gaps to fill for next cycle
