- **Communication Templates** - Pre-built templates for stakeholder updates and escalations
- **Runbook Integration** - Generate actionable runbooks from incident patterns

## Skills Included

### Core Tools

1. **Incident Classifier** (`incident_classifier.py`)
   - Analyzes incident descriptions and outputs severity levels
   - Recommends response teams and initial actions
   - Generates communication templates based on severity

2. **Timeline Reconstructor** (`timeline_reconstructor.py`)
   - Processes timestamped events from multiple sources
   - Reconstructs chronological incident timeline

3. **PIR Generator** (`pir_generator.py`)
   - Creates comprehensive Post-Incident Review documents
   - Applies multiple RCA frameworks (5 Whys, Fishbone, Timeline)
   - Generates actionable follow-up items

## Incident Response Framework

### Severity Classification System

#### SEV1 - Critical Outage
**Definition:** Complete service failure affecting all users or critical business functions

**Characteristics:**
- Customer-facing services completely unavailable
- Data loss or corruption affecting users
- Security breaches with customer data exposure
- Revenue-generating systems down
- SLA violations with financial penalties

**Response Requirements:**
- Immediate escalation to on-call engineer
- Incident Commander assigned within 5 minutes
- Executive notification within 15 minutes
- Public status page update within 15 minutes
- War room established
- All hands on deck if needed

**Communication Frequency:** Every 15 minutes until resolution

#### SEV2 - Major Impact
**Definition:** Significant degradation affecting subset of users or non-critical functions

**Characteristics:**
- Partial service degradation (>25% of users affected)
- Performance issues causing user frustration
- Non-critical features unavailable
- Internal tools impacting productivity
- Data inconsistencies not affecting user experience

**Response Requirements:**
- On-call engineer response within 15 minutes
- Incident Commander assigned within 30 minutes
- Status page update within 30 minutes
- Stakeholder notification within 1 hour
- Regular team updates

**Communication Frequency:** Every 30 minutes during active response

#### SEV3 - Minor Impact
**Definition:** Limited impact with workarounds available

**Characteristics:**
- Single feature or component affected

### Incident Commander Role

#### Primary Responsibilities

1. **Command and Control**
   - Own the incident response process
   - Make critical decisions about resource allocation
   - Coordinate between technical teams and stakeholders
   - Maintain situational awareness across all response streams

2. **Communication Hub**
   - Provide regular updates to stakeholders
   - Manage external communications (status pages, customer notifications)
   - Facilitate effective communication between response teams
   - Shield responders from external distractions

3. **Process Management**
   - Ensure proper incident tracking and documentation
   - Drive toward resolution while maintaining quality
   - Coordinate handoffs between team members
   - Plan and execute rollback strategies if needed

4. **Post-Incident Leadership**
   - Ensure thorough post-incident reviews are conducted
   - Drive implementation of preventive measures
   - Share learnings with broader organization

#### Decision-Making Framework

**Emergency Decisions (SEV1/2):**
- Incident Commander has full authority
- Bias toward action over analysis
- Document decisions for later review
- Consult subject matter experts but don't get blocked

**Resource Allocation:**
- Can pull in any necessary team members
- Authority to escalate to senior leadership
- Can approve emergency spend for external resources
- Make call on communication channels and timing

**Technical Decisions:**
- Lean on technical leads for implementation details
- Make final calls on trade-offs between speed and risk
- Approve rollback vs. fix-forward strategies
- Coordinate testing and validation approaches

## Best Practices

### During Incident Response

1. **Maintain Calm Leadership**
   - Stay composed under pressure
   - Make decisive calls with incomplete information
   - Communicate confidence while acknowledging uncertainty

2. **Document Everything**
   - All actions taken and their outcomes
   - Decision rationale, especially for controversial calls
   - Timeline of events as they happen

3. **Effective Communication**
   - Use clear, jargon-free language
   - Provide regular updates even when there's no new information
   - Manage stakeholder expectations proactively

4. **Technical Excellence**
   - Prefer rollbacks to risky fixes under pressure
   - Validate fixes before declaring resolution
   - Plan for secondary failures and cascading effects

### Post-Incident

1. **Blameless Culture**
   - Focus on system failures, not individual mistakes
   - Encourage honest reporting of what went wrong
   - Celebrate learning and improvement opportunities

2. **Action Item Discipline**
   - Assign specific owners and due dates
   - Track progress publicly
   - Prioritize based on risk and effort

3. **Knowledge Sharing**
   - Share PIRs broadly within the organization
   - Update runbooks based on lessons learned
   - Conduct training sessions for common failure modes

4. **Continuous Improvement**
   - Look for patterns across multiple incidents
   - Invest in tooling and automation
   - Regularly review and update processes

## Conclusion

The Incident Commander skill provides a comprehensive framework for managing incidents from detection through post-incident review. By implementing structured processes, clear communication templates, and thorough analysis tools, teams can improve their incident response capabilities and build more resilient systems.

The key to successful incident management is preparation, practice, and continuous learning. Use this framework as a starting point, but adapt it to your organization's specific needs, culture, and technical environment.

Remember: The goal isn't to prevent all incidents (which is impossible), but to detect them quickly, respond effectively, communicate clearly, and learn continuously.
