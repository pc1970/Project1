# A text adventure Game - a Java Project.
NoDodolCastle 
This is simple console game with no Graphic User Interface (GUI), where the player interacts with the game via the console. 
The winning strategy of the game is to attack the monster before the damage on the user surpasses that of the monster. 
This is achieved through the player having an orb power of 1, having this Orb on the tableValues index, which depends on the checking index. 
The winning strategy here is quite probabilistic as the chances of getting the Orb is random. 
Alternatively, the user can win the game by exhausting the monster power to zero. This will involve gaining more orb power while attacking. 
This way the user will be added 5 power units every time the orb is gained. The user can choose to sense the orb using the command provided until the orb is gained.
